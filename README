HxC Floppy Emulator Manager for DOS
-----------------------------------

A port of the Amiga manager code to Microsoft C 6.0.
Other versions of Microsoft C may work but are untested.
Should work on everything from an IBM PC with MDA upwards.
The prebuilt exe has been packed with UPX.

Usage: HXCFS [driveid]

driveid		The drive index of the HxC (0-3, default 0)

Questions? Get in touch with me (bjt) on the HxC forum or vogons.org.
